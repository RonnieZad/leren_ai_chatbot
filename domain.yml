  utter_what_is_dysmenorrhea:
  - text: |-
      Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for pain with your period (menstruation) or menstrual cramps. There are two types of dysmenorrhea that is primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea is the name for common menstrual cramps that come back over and over again (recurrent) and aren‚Äôt due to other diseases

      COMMON CAUSES

      Menstrual cramps can have causes that aren‚Äôt due to underlying disease. Examples include normal periods, heavy periods, wind or constipation. 
  utter_treat_cramps:

  - text: I have been told that a hot water bottle can help to ease te pain in the lower abdomen
  - text: You could take a warm bath
  - text: Sometimes cramps come with migraines, you want to som painkillers
  - text: Take ibuprofen it will really help you
  - text: |-
      Lifestyle and home remedies
      Besides getting enough sleep and rest, things you might want to try include:

      Exercise regularly. Physical activity, including sex, helps ease menstrual cramps for some women.
      Use heat. Soaking in a hot bath or using a heating pad, hot water bottle or heat patch on your lower abdomen might ease menstrual cramps.
      Try dietary supplements. A number of studies have indicated that vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1 (thiamin), vitamin B-6 and magnesium supplements might reduce menstrual cramps.
      Reduce stress. Psychological stress might increase your risk of menstrual cramps and their severity.

  utter_faq_about_muk:
  - text: |-
      Established in 1922 as a humble technical school, Makerere University is one of the oldest and most prestigious Universities in Africa. In January of that year, the school, which was later renamed Uganda Technical College, opened its doors to 14 day students who began studying Carpentry, Building and Mechanics.

      The College soon began offering various other courses in Medical Care, Agriculture , Veterinary Sciences and Teacher Training. It expanded over the years to become a Center for Higher Education in East Africa in 1935. In 1937, the College started developing into an institution of higher education, offering post-school certificate courses.

  utter_what_is_erection:
  - text: An erection happens when the penis fills with blood, making the penis larger and harder. Erections usually go away on their own or after ejaculation (releasing semen through the urethra). Although people may experience erections when they are younger, they may happen more often and unexpectedly during puberty.
  utter_do_erections_hurt:
  - text: Erections do not commonly hurt. They are a normal part of male sexual arousal. No two people are exactly the same in how they respond sexually. The male genital skin is loose and mobile, which allows for the penis to get larger and harder during an erection
  utter_blue_balls:
  - text: |-
      Blue balls is a slang term for the achy feeling people get in their genitals when there is a buildup of blood in the genital area during sexual arousal. Some people notice this feeling especially strong in the testicles.  Because the blood that has built up in the genital area is not returning to pick up more oxygen, it can make the skin in the area a bit bluish in colour. This cannot hurt you.  As soon as the blood begins to move away from the genital area, which can happen if the person orgasms or is not sexually aroused anymore, the discomfort usually goes away quickly. 

      Some people use the idea of blue balls as an excuse to pressure other people to have sex with them.  This type of pressure is coercion and is not part of a healthy consent conversation.
  utter_semen_sticky:
  - text: Semen is sticky because it has a sugar called fructose in it.
  utter_urine_sperm:
  - text: No. While sperm and urine both pass through the urethra, they can‚Äôt come out at the same time.
  utter_circumscised_meaning:
  - text: Before birth, the penis develops with loose skin covering the end of it, called the foreskin. Circumcision is a procedure to remove the foreskin, usually at birth or shortly after. It‚Äôs often done by a doctor or trained religious person. A circumcised penis looks different from an uncircumcised penis because there‚Äôs no foreskin covering the end, but both work the same way
  utter_impotent_meaning:
  - text: Impotent means that a person with a penis can‚Äôt get or keep an erection.
  utter_about_breast:
  - text: Breasts are made of nerves, arteries, blood vessels, milk ducts, fat tissue, connective fibers and lymph channels.
  utter_breast_size:
  - text: When breasts are growing, they change shape and size until they are fully developed. During this time, you may notice that one breast is bigger. Breasts usually even out as they develop, but if they end up being slightly different sizes that‚Äôs normal too.
  utter_breasts_milk:
  - text: Breasts don‚Äôt always have milk in them. When a woman is pregnant, their body makes hormones to get the breasts ready to feed the baby after it‚Äôs born. Once the baby is born, the hormones signal the breasts to start making milk. When the baby breastfeeds, milk leaves the breast and the hormones keep signaling the breasts to make more milk.
  utter_about_hymen:
  - text: The hymen is a fold of tissue within the vagina that partially covers the opening. The hymen is usually there at birth, although people can also be born without a hymen. Hymens can be different shapes and sizes
  utter_about_womb:
  - text: A womb is another word for a uterus. The uterus is a reproductive organ where a baby grows during pregnancy
  utter_pelvic_exam:
  - text: |-
      A pelvic exam is part of a regular physical checkup.  During the exam a health care provider examines the pelvic organs (vagina, cervix, uterus and ovaries). During a pelvic exam you might be checked:

      to make sure the reproductive organs are healthy
      for sores and lumps on the genitals
      for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      for infections in the vagina (e.g., yeast or bacterial vaginosis)
      A pelvic exam may include a Pap test. A Pap test looks for changes in the cells of the cervix. A sample of cells is collected and tested for changes that could turn into cervical cancer. 
  utter_vagina_penis:
  - text: Yes. Some people are born with both a penis and a vagina or parts of each. This is called ‚Äòintersex‚Äô
  utter_origin_vagina_penis:
  - text: Most anatomical and medical words come from Latin. Penis comes from the Latin word for tail, and vagina comes from the Latin word for a sheath or covering.
  utter_how_condom_works:
  - text: |-
      A condom is a thin covering that fits over a hard penis. It decreases the risk of pregnancy and STIs by creating a barrier that stops sperm and body fluids from passing between partners.

      With typical use (not following exact directions) a condom is 82% effective. With perfect use a condom is 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms give good protection from STIs and HIV.
  utter_how_to_put_condom:
  - text: |-
      Check the expiry date (don‚Äôt use if expired). Squeeze the package to make sure it‚Äôs sealed; no air should come out.
      Push the condom to one end of the package. Open carefully at the other end. Don‚Äôt use scissors, fingernails, or teeth as you might damage the condom.
      Pinch the tip of the condom to squeeze out the air.
      Put the condom on the end of the hard penis. If not circumcised, pull back the foreskin.
      Unroll the condom all the way down the base of the penis.
      After you ejaculate (cum) and the penis is still hard, hold onto the condom and pull out.
      Carefully remove the condom, and tie it in a knot to keep the fluid inside.
      Throw the used condom in the garbage; don‚Äôt flush it down the toilet.
      Never reuse a condom. Never use two male condoms or a vaginal condom and a male condom at the same time, as the risk of both breaking increases.
  utter_how_to_know_condom_safe:
  - text: |-
      To ensure a condom is safe to use check the:

      expiry date (don‚Äôt use if it‚Äôs expired)
      the package (squeeze it to make sure it‚Äôs sealed-don‚Äôt use it if air comes out)
      Latex and polyurethane condoms will help protect you from pregnancy, STIs and HIV. Lambskin condoms will help protect you from pregnancy, but not STIs or HIV. 
  utter_condom_flavors:
  - text: Yes, some condoms are flavoured. This is to encourage the use of condoms for oral sex. They can be used on a penis or can be used to make to make a dental dam.
  utter_keep_condom_wallet:
  - text: Yes, you can store latex condoms in a wallet for up to 1 month. Condoms are sensitive to heat, cold, folding, sunlight, and rubbing. Keep condoms in their package, and store at room temperature and out of direct sunlight.
  utter_vaginal_condom:
  - text: |-
      A vaginal condom is a soft, plastic (non-latex) sleeve with two flexible rings, one on each end. It‚Äôs sometimes called a female or internal condom. The closed, inner ring goes inside the vagina. The outer ring stays outside the vagina to cover the genitals. The vaginal condom is used for vaginal sex. It decreases the risk of pregnancy and STIs and HIV by stopping semen and body fluid from passing between partners.

      With typical use (not following exact directions) a vaginal condom is 79% effective. With perfect use the vaginal condom is 95% effective at preventing pregnancy. Vaginal condoms give good protection from STIs and HIV.

      Never use a vaginal and a male condom at the same time, as it increases the risk of both breaking. Condoms used with another method of birth control (pill, patch, injection, ring, IUD) give the best protection from pregnancy, STIs and HIV. Never reuse a condom.
  utter_birth_control_no_pills:
  - text: |-
      There are many kinds of birth control methods. They include:

      barrier methods (e.g., male and vaginal condoms)
      hormonal methods (e.g., pill, patch, hormonal IUD, injection, ring)
      non-hormonal methods (e.g., copper IUD, fertility awareness)
      Talk to your health care provider or go to a sexual and reproductive health clinic to find out what birth control methods will work best for you
  utter_dental_dam:
  - text: |-
      A dental dam (also called an oral dam or latex barrier) is a thin rectangular piece of latex used to prevent the spread of STIs during oral sex in the anal or vaginal area. It helps to reduce spreading bodily fluids.  You can buy dental dams at some drugstores. You can make your own dam out of a condom (latex or non-latex). To make a dam you need a new, rolled up condom and a pair of scissors. Check the expiry date (don‚Äôt use if expired) and check that the package doesn‚Äôt have any holes.

      While the condom is still rolled up, cut the tip off.
      Keep the condom rolled and put the scissors through the middle and cut through 1 die of the ring.
      Unroll the condom and use it like a dam
  utter_how_use_dental_dam:
  - text: |-
      Before use, hold it up to the light and check for holes
      Hold the dental dam in place of the anal or vaginal area and don‚Äôt let it flip over. Consider marking one side so you know which side your mouth goes on
      Throw it in the garbage ;  don‚Äôt flush down the toilet

      Emergency contraception helps prevent pregnancy if you‚Äôve had unprotected sex or are not sure if you‚Äôre protected from pregnancy. You can use EC to help prevent pregnancy if a condom broke or leaked, no birth control was used, a regular method of birth control wasn‚Äôt used correctly or there was a sexual assault. EC should be used as soon as possible after unprotected sex.

      There are two types of EC:

      Is it okay to use more than one method of birth control?
      It depends on the method of birth control. Using a male or vaginal condom along with another method of birth control like the pill, patch, ring or IUD is called ‚Äôdual method‚Äô. Dual method use provides the best protection from pregnancy, STIs and HIV.

      Never use two male condoms or a vaginal and a male condom at the same time, as the risk of both breaking increases

      vaginal sex (penis to vagina)
      anal sex (penis to anus)
      oral sex (mouth to anus or genitals)
      For some people, abstinence may include certain types of sexual contact.

      You can‚Äôt get pregnant if you are abstinent (when there is no genital contact). You can get pregnant if sperm is near the opening of the vagina. You can‚Äôt get STIs if you don‚Äôt have skin-to-skin contact or pass body fluids between partners.
  utter_pulling_out_work:

      Withdrawal is often referred to as ‚Äôpulling out‚Äô. Withdrawal is used during sex to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Withdrawal is when the penis is pulled out of the vagina before ejaculation (cum). A person must not ejaculate near the genitals. Pregnancy can occur if sperm is near the genitals or in the vagina.

      With typical use (not following the exact directions) withdrawal is 78% effective. It requires self-control and it can be hard to stop and withdraw the penis before ejaculation.

      Cervical cancer happens when some of the cells on the cervix become abnormal, then grow out of control. Abnormal cervical cells rarely cause symptoms. A person may have some of the symptoms below if those cell changes grow into cervical cancer:

      bleeding from the vagina that‚Äôs not normal (e.g., bleeding between menstrual periods, after sex, or after menopause)
      pain in the lower belly or pelvis
      pain during sex
      vaginal discharge that‚Äôs different than usual
      Cervical cancer is mostly prevented by screening and follow-up care. Regular Pap tests can find abnormal cell changes in the cervix early; before they become cancerous. HPV causes almost all cases of cervical cancers in women. The HPV vaccine protects people against HPV infection by 9 common, and high risk HPV strains.
  utter_what_is_menstruation:
  - text: |-
      Menstruation is also called ‚Äôhaving your period‚Äô. Sometime during puberty, ovaries begin releasing one egg (ovum) each month. If a sperm fertilizes the egg, it could grow into a baby. To get ready for the fertilized egg, the uterus builds a thick lining of blood and tissue. This lining is where the fertilized egg would grow into a baby.

      If the sperm doesn‚Äôt fertilize the egg, the egg and the lining of the uterus flow out the vagina. This flow is called menstruation or a period. A person‚Äôs period usually lasts 3 to 7 days. The time between the beginning of one period to the next is called the menstrual cycle. A menstrual cycle lasts about 24 to 38 days, but can vary from person to person

      Menstrual cramps are the uterus contracting to push out the menstrual flow. The hormone changes that happen during the menstrual cycle can also lead to cramping. Cramps usually happen just before or just when the period starts (the bleeding part of the menstrual cycle).
      Cramps can feel like a dull ache or a sharp squeeze in the lower abdomen (the area between the belly button and groin) and may also cause pain or discomfort in the lower back, hips and thighs. The intensity of cramps can vary from person to person and can change throughout a person‚Äôs life.

      Tampons are available with and without applicators. When learning, it‚Äôs usually easier to use ones with applicators. Follow the directions that come with the tampons. Most also have diagrams included. 

      Before inserting a tampon, wash your hands with soap and water. Find a comfortable position, squatting or sitting with your legs apart or having one foot on the toilet seat. Once you have found a position that is comfortable for you:

      Hold the applicator securely at the grip marks with your thumb and middle finger.
      Insert the top part of the applicator into your vagina at a slight angle upwards and towards your lower back.
      Continue to slide the applicator into the vagina until your hand that‚Äôs holding the applicator touches your body.
      With your index finger, push the bottom of the applicator all the way up. This pushes the tampon out of the applicator and into your vagina.
      Gently pull the applicator out and throw it in the garbage.
      The tampon will remain inside of you, the string will hang outside the vaginal opening. When it is time to remove you can gently pull on the string until the tampon is all of the way out. Wash your hands after you remove the tampon.

      If the tampon is in correctly, you should not be able to feel it. If it feels uncomfortable, it may not be in far enough and you can remove the tampon and try again with a new one. 
  utter_tamppon_get_lost:
  - text: It is extremely unlikely for a tampon to get stuck in the vagina. Tampons are attached to a string a few inches in length that hangs through the vaginal opening.

      It‚Äôs normal to have disagreements from time to time. They give you a chance to explore things that you disagree about, and it can help make your feelings clear.
      Disagreements that often turn into fights that include yelling, criticism or harsh words are signs of an unhealthy relationship. It‚Äôs a problem if you‚Äôre fighting all of the time, or if you say cruel things when you‚Äôre arguing. Remember; physical fighting (punching, hitting) is NEVER okay.
      Signs of a healthy relationship are:

      respect
      honesty
      communication
      being able to be yourself
      feeling safe

      A virus is a kind of germ that‚Äôs so small even a regular microscope can‚Äôt see it. Viruses are the smallest and simplest of all germs, but they are also some of the deadliest. Different viruses cause different diseases. Vaccines can prevent some viruses.
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by a virus (like Herpes and HIV) can‚Äôt be cured, but can be treated to help manage symptoms. STI has replaced the term STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease). In medical science, infection is the term used to talk about a bacteria, virus, parasite or other microbe that has entered the body and begun to multiply. The term disease indicates that signs and symptoms of illness are present. There are many people with STIs who have no symptoms, therefore STI is a more accurate term.

      Many STIs don‚Äôt have symptoms, especially when the infection first starts. When an STI is found and treated early, it can lower the chances of having complications and can prevent the infection from spreading to sexual partners. As with any infection, prevention is important. You can prevent getting an STI by:
      talking to your partner about using protection and each other‚Äôs history of STIs, before sexual activity oral, vaginal sex) getting tested regularly for STIs, even if you don‚Äôt have any symptoms
      getting immunized against Hepatitis A/a, Hepatitis B/a and

      STIs spread through sexual contact involving the genitals, mouth or rectum. Some infections (such as Chlamydia, and Hepatitis A, B and C) can also be spread through other means such as:

      skin-to-skin contact (e.g., kissing, non-penetrating sex or body rubbing)
      mixing infected body fluids (such as blood, semen or vaginal secretions)
      sharing needles, other drug paraphernalia and through needle stick injuries
      from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby, as the baby‚Äôs being born during a vaginal delivery
      through breastmilk to a baby
      Use a condom or dental dam every time you have sex (anal, oral, vaginal) to reduce the risk of STIs and HIV.
  utter_get_sti_oral_sex:
  - text: Yes, oral sex without using a condom, vaginal condom or dental dam has a risk of an STI and HIV because of skin-to-skin contact and passing bodily fluids between partners. Use a condom or dental dam every time you have sex (anal, oral, vaginal) to reduce the risk of STIs and HIV.
  utter_get_sti_kissing:
  - text: Yes, oral herpes can be passed to partners by kissing, if the person with oral herpes has a cold sore when kissing happens. People can get cold sores (oral herpes) from sharing drinks, lip balm or kissing. Avoid these activities when someone has a visible cold sore. You can also ask your friend or partner with oral herpes to let you know about their symptoms so you can be aware of when the herpes virus is active (which is when it can be spread).
  utter_get_sti_toilet:
  - text: It would be extremely difficult for you to get an STI from a toilet seat. Sex germs are fragile and they have a hard time surviving outside of the body.

      HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that weakens the immune system and makes it difficult to fight diseases and infections.
      AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a combination of having HIV and one or more infections or diseases. Because HIV has damaged the immune system, the body can‚Äôt protect against or fight infections or diseases and a person becomes very sick. There is no cure for HIV, but medicine can be taken to help keep the immune system strong, allowing people with HIV to live for many years.

  utter_what_are_wetdreams:
  - text: The scientific term for a wet dream is nocturnal emissions. A wet dream is when a penis gets erect (hard), and ejaculates (releases semen) while a person is asleep. A sign that a nocturnal emission has happened is waking up in damp pyjamas and bed sheets. Nocturnal emissions usually begin during puberty as the body produces more testosterone. Some people experience them and some may find them embarrassing, but they are completely normal.

      Unfortunately, yes.
      When you climax, the muscles around your genitals ‚Äì including the sphincter muscle ‚Äì relax, so it‚Äôs not unusual for a little gas to escape. But even before orgasm, the in-and-out motion may trigger gas because the penis rubs against the anus through the vaginal wall, she says.
      The fix: If it happens frequently, take an over-the-counter anti-gas medication that contains simethicone before having sex.

      For starters, a good cardiovascular routine helps build energy and stamina.
      Strength training and stretching can help you build muscles and improve flexibility so you can get into ‚Äì and maintain ‚Äì various sex positions.
      The best exercise to improve sex is the Kegel squeeze. It‚Äôs basically strength training for your pubococcygeus (or PC) muscles, which hold up your vagina, anus, uterus, bladder and urethra.
      The stronger these muscles, the more intense your orgasms, Try it: Your first step is to locate your PC muscles by trying to stop your urine flow when you pee.
      Hold theb squeeze for five seconds, then release.
      Do 50-150 Kegel squeezes a day to keep those muscles in good shape.
      Warning: Don‚Äôt do Kegels regularly while urinating. This can lead to urinary tract and bladder infections.

      Nope. In fact, about 70% of women don‚Äôt orgasm during intercourse without direct clitoral stimulation.
      If you can‚Äôt have orgasms with intercourse, you‚Äôre normal.
      Sometimes women get upset because their partners say, ‚ÄòMy last lover could have orgasms, so there must be something wrong with you‚Äô
      Assuming you don‚Äôt dump him for being insensitive, point out the statistics.
      Next, let him know that it‚Äôs perfectly OK for one of you to lend a hand.
      Touching your clitoris during sex really ups the chances that you‚Äôll have an orgasm.
      If you‚Äôve never experienced an orgasm ‚Äì and about 10% of women haven‚Äôt ‚Äì consider investing in lubricants (not oil, which can irritate sensitive vaginal tissues) and experiment alone. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if there are no immediate fireworks.

      You‚Äôre probably worrying needlessly.
      If you‚Äôre concerned, see your gynecologist because strong odor (and discharge) is a sign of a bacterial infection.
      If there‚Äôs no infection and you‚Äôre still worried, avoiding spicy or pungent foods may help.
      Or try an over-the-counter product called Rephresh, It rebalances the vagina‚Äôs pH and makes you more fragrant.
      Don‚Äôt use douches or feminine sprays. They can irritate and can alter the vagina‚Äôs natural flora. That increases your risk of getting an infection and masks an existing one.

  utter_why_does_sex_hurt:
  - text: |-
      Probably this question is really about intercourse, and probably it‚Äôs the receiving partner ‚Äî the one whose vagina or anus is being inserted into ‚Äî who‚Äôs asking it. There are three main reasons for pain with vaginal or anal intercourse. The first is insufficient lubrication, especially an issue with anal sex ‚Äî you MUST use lube for this activity. Not enough lubrication results in friction and pain.
      The second is insufficient arousal. The body reacts to arousal with blood flow to the genitals (that‚Äôs where erections come from), and arousal changes the sensations of genital touch and insertion and helps them feel more pleasurable. For women, the clitoris, not generally inside the vagina, is the focal point of physical arousal.
      The third is size, especially penis length, since some women find it very painful when a long penis hits their cervix during intercourse. There are some health problems that might also result in pain, but these three are definitely the most common issues.

  utter_how_does_sex_feel:
  - text: |-
      Sex can feel many different ways, depending on what kind of sex it is and the degree of comfort and arousal of the people having it. Best-case, pleasurable sensations flood not just your genitals but your whole body, making you feel increasingly erotic and aroused, often to the point of having an orgasm (often called a ‚Äòclimax,‚Äô which is a pretty good description of the result of these feelings that just get better and better). In this scenario, it can also amplify feelings of caring and love you have for your partner, so it can be an emotional experience and not just a physical one.
      BUT! Worst-case, it can be painful, frightening, and unpleasant, especially if you don‚Äôt really want to do it and are not aroused. Many people have sex before they‚Äôre ready, without enthusiastic consent, or before they know what their body needs to have it be a pleasurable experience, and often have sex with partners who don‚Äôt know that information either. And it‚Äôs quite possible to have sex feel great for one partner and pretty terrible for the other ‚Äî you can deal with this discrepancy through communication, caring, and learning more about sexuality, but for many people, sex doesn‚Äôt feel anywhere near as good as it could feel and as they hope it will feel.

Without everything going on in our brains, we wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in sex at all, nor find sex anything of interest. It‚Äôs also important to note that not everyone is neurotypical, so on top of all the other ways we vary, all our nervous systems don‚Äôt work in exactly the same way.'

  - text: |-
      It depends on what kind of sex you want to have! But if you are referring to intercourse, where one person inserts a body part into an orifice of another, the first thing you need is a partner who wants to do the same thing with you
      You don‚Äôt have to read their mind; you can ask. Some partners will have specific desires or restrictions, including safer sex requirements.
      The next thing: Both people should get as aroused as possible, which means mentally AND physically desiring to connect in this way. Physical arousal makes penises hard, can make vaginas get wet, and can make the sensations of all the body parts involved feel better ‚Äî but even so, it‚Äôs good to have some lubricant so that maximum comfort is possible, since vaginal and anal insertion can hurt if there isn‚Äôt enough lubrication. For many people, it takes time to get aroused enough, and insertion shouldn‚Äôt happen until the person being penetrated wants it./nMany things can be arousing: kissing, touching, embracing each other so your bodies are in close contact, rubbing against each other, genital touch, oral sex‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just for starters! Once a penis or fingers are in a vagina, generally people enjoy an in-and-out motion.. It‚Äôs possible to be too rough, or even (more rarely) too slow and gentle, depending on your partner‚Äôs desires, so ask what they like the best.
  utter_what_is_sex:
  - text: |-
      A lot of experts might define sex in terms of intercourse, or even in terms of physical things that two people can do together, and my definition includes those, but it‚Äôs broader. One reason for this is that people express their sexual feelings in so many different ways that in order to be inclusive, we have to be pretty far-reaching.
      So I‚Äôd define sex as anything one or more people can do to evoke or satisfy erotic feelings, and we can define ‚Äòerotic‚Äô as that which makes you feel sexual desire and/or arousal. This definition of sex allows for masturbation (‚Äòsolo sex‚Äô), erotic experiences that two people can share including oral, manual (with hands), and intercourse (‚Äòpartner sex‚Äô). Most sexual experiences involve some degree of genital stimulation, though not all do; some people can feel sexually aroused, and even orgasm, without including direct genital touch. Some people choose to differentiate between ‚Äòhaving sex‚Äô and ‚Äòbeing sexual‚Äô: the latter might not be as genitally focused or might not include intercourse, but is WAY more sexy than just shaking hands.
  utter_how_to_orgasm:
  - text: |-
      If this question means how does a woman make sure she has an orgasm during a night of sex, then it‚Äôs about a woman figuring out what makes her have an orgasm and how to incorporate that into sexual activity with her partner. This comes easily for some women and not so easily for others.
      We live in a culture where women are often more comfortable with romantic thoughts and less so with sexual thoughts that may be more effective in leading to arousal and orgasm./nWhen orgasm doesn‚Äôt occur easily or naturally for a woman, I suggest sexual fantasizing, masturbation, use of a vibrator, and a visit to a sexual resource center. If you can do it on your own, it‚Äôs often easier to graduate to doing it with a partner.
      If the question means how to make sure to have an orgasm during penile sexual intercourse, that‚Äôs a tougher question. I would suggest that this is not a worthwhile goal, at least all the time, as it could require a fair amount of logistics; nothing wrong with taking turns.

This is about 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy after a condom breaks. It can also be used for up to the next 10 years for contraception, if desired.  You can do this five to seven days after the condom breaks.
      Go directly to the pharmacy and pick up over-the-counter Plan B (levonorgestrel, a progestin). You can do this most effectively up to three days after the condom breaks.

It certainly seems to matter to some men for bragging rights and for the amount they trash talk about it. It may also matter for some men and women in terms of how a certain size penis feels during intercourse. Penis size does not matter in terms of ability to have an orgasm or being able to get a woman pregnant.
  utter_is_vaginal_discharge_normal:
  - text: |-
      A woman normally produces a vaginal discharge that usually is described as clear or slightly cloudy, non-irritating, and odor-free. During the normal menstrual cycle, the amount and consistency of discharge can vary. At one time of the month, there may be a small amount of a very thin or watery discharge; and at another time, a more extensive thicker discharge may appear. All of these excretions could be considered normal.
      A vaginal discharge that has an odor or that is irritating usually is considered an abnormal discharge. The irritation might be itching or burning, or both. The itching may be present at any time of the day, but it often is most bothersome at night. These symptoms often are made worse by sexual intercourse. It is important to see your gynecologist if there has been a change in the amount, color, or smell of the discharge.

      If you forget to take a birth control pill, take it as soon as you remember. If you don‚Äôt remember until the next day, go ahead and take two pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for two days, take two pills the day you remember and two pills the next day. You will then be back on schedule. If you miss more than two pills, call your health care provider for instructions. Those instructions may be to take one pill daily until Sunday and then start a new pack or to discard the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day.
      Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. When you forget to take a birth control pill, you increase the chance of releasing an egg from your ovary. However, if you forget to take any of the last seven out of the 28 day pills, you will not raise your chance of pregnancy, because these pills contain only inactive ingredients. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more pills, get a pregnancy test. If you miss two periods even though you have taken all your pills on schedule, you should get a pregnancy test.

It turns out there are likely not sperm in pre-ejaculate and what actually accounts for the relatively high failure rate is that the man doesn‚Äôt actually pull out.
